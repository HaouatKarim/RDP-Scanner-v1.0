# RDP IP Range Fetcher & RDP Port Scanner

This repository includes two scripts designed for network reconnaissance and cybersecurity assessment. **RDP IP Range Fetcher** collects IP ranges from major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) based on specified regions. **RDP Port Scanner** then scans the collected IP ranges for open RDP ports (port 3389) and provides a list of detected RDP services.

## Overview

### RDP IP Range Fetcher
The **RDP IP Range Fetcher** script retrieves IP ranges from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) based on specified regions. This functionality enables focused scanning on a subset of IP ranges. Supported regions include `eu`, `ap`, `us`, and more.

### RDP Port Scanner
The **RDP Port Scanner** script scans through the provided IP ranges to detect open RDP ports (port 3389). The scanner is equipped with manual interruption, allowing users to skip the current range by pressing `ENTER`. The tool outputs a list of detected RDP servers to a file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+** - Required to run the scripts.
- **termcolor Module** - Enables colored console output.
- **nmap** - Used by the RDP Port Scanner for network scanning. Make sure `nmap` is installed and available in your systemâ€™s PATH.

> **Note**: This project also uses standard Python libraries (`json`, `argparse`, `subprocess`, `threading`, `time`) that do not require installation.

## Usage

### RDP IP Range Fetcher
This script fetches IP ranges from cloud providers based on a specified region.

#### Arguments:
- `--region`, `-r`: Specifies the region to focus on (e.g., `eu`, `us`, `ap`, etc.).
- `--output`, `-o`: Specifies the output file name for saving IP ranges (default: `RDP_Range.txt`).

#### Command:
```
python rdp_ip_fetcher.py --region us --output RDP_Range.txt
```

### RDP Port Scanner
The RDP Port Scanner reads IP ranges from a file and scans for open RDP ports (port 3389). During each range scan, you can press `ENTER` to skip the current IP range if needed.

#### Arguments:
- `--input`, `-i`: Specifies the input file with IP ranges to scan (default: `RDP_Range.txt`).
- `--output`, `-o`: Specifies the output file for saving detected RDP IPs (default: `All_RDP.txt`).

#### Command:
```
python rdp_port_scanner.py --input RDP_Range.txt --output All_RDP.txt
```

## Example Usage

### 1. Fetch IP Ranges
```
python rdp_ip_fetcher.py --region us --output RDP_Range.txt
```
This command fetches IP ranges for AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure in the `us` region and saves them to `RDP_Range.txt`.

### 2. Scan for Open RDP Ports
```
python rdp_port_scanner.py --input RDP_Range.txt --output All_RDP.txt
```
This command reads each IP range from `RDP_Range.txt`, scans for open RDP ports, and writes detected IPs to `All_RDP.txt`.
